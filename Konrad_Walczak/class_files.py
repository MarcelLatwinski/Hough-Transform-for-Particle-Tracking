        Constructor function for class Single_Particle_Tracking, particle can be given a custom name via |name| (to be used later

        Variables in function are:
        self.name - type: string, name of a particle 
        self.q - type: int, randomly assigned electric charge of a particle
        self.layers - type: int, amount of detectors where particle's position is measured
        self.params - type: int, parameters influencing particle's behaviour (mass, velocity, magnetic field etc.) #TODO: currently assumed to be of unity
        self.theta0 - type: float, initial angle of emission of a particle, randomly generated value from an interval of (0, PI/4)
        self.r - type: np.array [1, 2, 3 ... 9] of len(layers), measurements of particle's radial position in polar coordinates at equally spaced detectors
        self.phi - type: np.array of len(layers) (by default set to None), measurments of particle's angular position in polar coordinated at equally spaced detectors
        
        Additional comment:
        Currently it is assumed that we work in 2D cross-section of a detector and particles can only travel in XY dimensions.

        '''
        Function used to randomize particle's path in the detector. Amount of noise at the detector can be specified via |noise_level|,
        whereas |max_divisor| is used for generation of a deterministic particle's path. This function currently modifies the values of self.phi.

        Firstly, a number from uniform distribution from interval (4, max_divisor) is scaled via self.params, this is angular_divisor.
        Secondly, a np.array of len(self.layers) of equally spaced angles between (0, PI/angular_divisor) and np.array of measurement_noise 
        (from a normal distribution of mean = 0, scale = noise_level; noise is assumed to be of a normal distribution as stated in Chapter 4.2 of [1]) are created.
        Lastly, depending on a particle's charge, both are either added or subtracted from the particle's initial angle, thus obtaining a path in the detector.

        Addition comment:
        Currently I believe this function is sufficient enough to generate simplified circular paths. However, this shall not remain unmodified and should be revised soon.
